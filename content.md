### Inspiration and Wisdom

* ["How To Be Effective"](http://www.pgbovine.net/productivity-tips.htm) by Philip J. Guo (no relation).

### Internships and Interviews

* From r/cscareerquestions: [internships FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/faq_internships) and [resume advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/25u0eo/could_we_create_a_basic_undergrad_resume/chktg4y/).
* Passing the average interview requires knowledge from both 61A and 61B, so plan to study ahead.
    * The most popular interview prep book is *[CTCI](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0984782850/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=5FQD69BDFX5C08415N34)*. It's worth getting.
* Freshmen are at a heavy disadvantage compared to sophomores and juniors.
    * If you get a lot of rejections, don't take it personally. Try again next year!
    * There are programs targeted toward freshmen. See ["CS Internships for Freshmen"](https://www.martystepp.com/cs-internships-for-freshmen/) by Marty Stepp.
