### Learning Python

* The official Python tutorial: [link](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).
* Practice problems:
    * Beginner practice problems: [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com/python).
    * Harder problems: [99 Prolog Problems](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems).
        * Many of these are beyond 61A's scope. Focus on the ones with a single asterisk (*).
        * These questions were written with a different language (Prolog) in mind, but you should be able to translate them to Python.
        * You can find answers [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/ProblemSets/99%20Prolog%20Problems%20Solutions).
    * Programming puzzles for the mathematically inclined: [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
    <!--
* Interested in how a programming language is specified? Check out the [language reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html). It tells you *exactly* what is valid Python and what isn't.
    * As the intro says, there are actually many implementations of Python. Don't forget that the Python interpreter is itself a program&mdash;in fact, it can be written in Python! More on this later.
* Real-world Python
    * Know the [built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html).
    * Know [collections](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html) and [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html).
    * Know pdb.
    -->

### Part I: Functional Abstraction

* Need practice with recursion?
    * Do some problems from [String-2](http://codingbat.com/python/String-2) and [List-2](http://codingbat.com/python/List-2) at CodingBat. Force yourself to use recursion instead of loops or built-in functions.
    * Similarly, check out the [lists section](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems/1) of 99 Prolog Problems.

### Part II: Data Abstraction
### Part III: Objects and Sequences
### Part IV: Interpreters and Data

### Inspiration and Wisdom

* ["Advice for Computer Science College Students"](http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/CollegeAdvice.html) from Joel Spolsky, blogger extraordinaire and cofounder of Stack Overflow (among other things).
* ["How To Be Effective"](http://www.pgbovine.net/productivity-tips.htm) by Philip J. Guo (no relation).
* ["The Comparison Trap"](http://99u.com/articles/33341/comparison-trap-envy-jealous-success-coworkers-friends) by Lauren Bacon.
* ["Why *SICP* Matters"](https://web.archive.org/web/20170609065124/https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/sicp.html) by Brian Harvey.
* [*50 Ways to Excel in Your First Job (and in Life)*](https://smile.amazon.com/Ways-Excel-Your-First-Life/dp/1530630134/) by Antonio Neves.

### Internships and Interviews

* From r/cscareerquestions: [internships FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/faq_internships) and [resume advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/25u0eo/could_we_create_a_basic_undergrad_resume/chktg4y/).
* Curated list of companies accepting applications: [link](http://www.intern.supply/).
* Passing the average interview requires knowledge from both 61A and 61B, so plan to study ahead.
    * The most popular interview prep book is *[CTCI](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0984782850/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=5FQD69BDFX5C08415N34)*. It's worth getting.
* Freshmen are at a heavy disadvantage compared to sophomores and juniors.
    * Take advantage of freshmen-specific programs. See [here](https://www.martystepp.com/cs-internships-for-freshmen/).
    * If you get a lot of rejections, don't take it personally. Try again next year!
* Coding interview tips: [link](https://www.interviewcake.com/article/python/coding-interview-tips).
* Lists of practice questions: [link 1](http://maxnoy.com/interviews.html), [link 2](http://www.programcreek.com/2012/11/top-10-algorithms-for-coding-interview/), [link 3](https://techiedelight.quora.com/500-Data-structures-and-algorithms-interview-questions-and-their-solutions).
